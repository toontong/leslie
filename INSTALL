Make sure you have lpeg library installed.

To install Leslie, copy entire leslie directory to Lua's package directory.

/usr/share/lua/5.1 (Ubuntu)

If you are not sure where package directory is located, check package.path
variable in Lua.

Another way to use Leslie is to modify package.path variable.

dir = "/path/where/leslie/is/located" -- /home/user/lua
pattern = dir .. "/?/init.lua;" .. dir .. "/?.lua;"
package.path = pattern .. package.path

If you have trouble installing Leslie, read the documentation about including
lua files
http://www.lua.org/pil/8.1.html
